# Utilities to explore parts of a tree-like or graph-like structure that is not known in advance

Traversal heuristics and various utilities to explore a tree-like or graph-like structure
from a given starting node
without prior knowledge of any other node or transition.
Target nodes are determined from a given origin node via the application of some unspecified steps.

Code initially made for another project of mine:
[hibou](https://github.com/erwanM974/hibou_label).
